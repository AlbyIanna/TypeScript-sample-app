# Boards Manager
This repo is made with the only intention to build a simple front-end application written in TypeScript.
The objective is to kinda simulate the behavior of a tool that detects which Arduino boards are plugged into your computer.


## Run
To run it locally, just clone the repo and move inside its directory:
```
git clone git@github.com:AlbyIanna/TypeScript-sample-app.git && TypeScript-sample-app

```
Then install node packages with:
```
npm i
```
And finally run it with:
```
npm start
```

You'll find the application up and running at http://localhost:8080/.

## Test
To run unit tests, just run this command:
```
npm t
```
To generate code coverage while running tests:
```
npm run coverage
```
